# MultiON_app
A FastAPI endpoint that takes an input image (a chat screenshot, a food/clothing item etc.) and automates browser actions accordingly using the MultiON API.
It is able to automate actions like scheduling meetings based on a chat's ss, ordering a food dish by only using its image etc.

## Usage

```
pip install uvicorn
uvicorn app:app --reload

```
